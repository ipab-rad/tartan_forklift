# tartan_dataset_management
Collection of tools to manage ROSbag recordings data from AV vehicle

## Metadata Generator Usage

This script generates metadata for ROSbag MCAP files. The metadata is compiled into a `resources.json` file that complies with the EIDF requirements

### Features
- Reads MCAP files and extracts metadata such as:
  - Duration of the log
  - Topics and message counts
  - File size
  - File hash (MD5)
- Generates a JSON file (`resources.json`) with metadata for all MCAP files in a given directory.
- Metadata includes:
  - File name
  - Identifier
  - Description
  - Format
  - License
  - Size
  - Hash
  - Issued date
  - Modified date
  - Duration
  - Topics and message counts

### Usage

#### 1. Setup

Ensure all dependencies are installed. You can use the following command to install required packages:

```bash
pip install mcap
```

#### 2. Running the Script

To generate the metadata JSON file, follow these steps:

- Place all your MCAP files in a directory.
- The default directory is `/recorded_datasets/edinburgh`
- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python metadata_generator.py
  ```

If you want to generate metadata for files in a specified path, run the script:

```bash
python metadata_generator.py -p path/to/file
```

#### 3. Output

The script will generate a `resources.json` file in the specified directory. This JSON file will contain metadata for each MCAP file in the directory.

## Upload Vehicle Data

This script automates the process of uploading rosbags from the IPAB-RAD autonomous vehicle server to a cloud instance within the [EIDF](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/) (Edinburgh International Data Facility) infrastructure. It streamlines data collection and transfer by first compressing the rosbags using the [MCAP CLI](https://mcap.dev/guides/cli), and then uploading the compressed files. This ensures efficient handling and storage of large datasets generated by vehicle sensors.

### 1. Dependencies

#### Host Machine (Cloud instance)
- Install `iperf3`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install iperf3
  ```
- Set up SSH key authentication:
  - Generate an SSH key:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
    ```
  - Copy the SSH key to the remote machine:
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id username@hostname_ip
    ```

#### Remote Machine (Vehicle Server)
- Install `iperf3`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install iperf3
  ```
- Install MCAP CLI `0.0.47` for compressing rosbags:
  ```bash
  wget -O $HOME/mcap https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/releases/download/releases%2Fmcap-cli%2Fv0.0.47/mcap-linux-amd64 && chmod +x $HOME/mcap
  ```

### 2. Usage
To execute the script, use the following command from the host machine:
  ```bash
  python3 upload_vehicle_data.py -config <path_to_yaml_config>
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  python3 upload_vehicle_data.py -c <path_to_yaml_config>
  ```
Replace `<path_to_yaml_config>` with the path to your YAML configuration file. Use the `-d` or `--debug` option to enable detailed information:
  ```bash
  python3 upload_vehicle_data.py -c <path_to_yaml_config> -d
  ```

### 3. YAML Parameters
- `remote_user` (str): Username for the remote machine.
- `remote_ip` (str): IP address of the remote machine (default: 129.215.117.104).
- `remote_directory` (str): Directory on the remote machine containing rosbags (default: /mnt/mydrive/rosbags).
- `cloud_upload_directory` (str): Remote directory for uploading compressed files (default: /mnt/vdb/data).
- `clean_up` (bool): Whether to delete all rosbags from the vehicle machine after uploading.
- `upload_attempts` (int): Number of attempts to upload each rosbag file to the cloud host (default: 3).
- `mcap_path` (str): Path to the mcap CLI binary. Found using `which mcap` if installed.
- `parallel_processes` (int): Number of parallel processes for compression and upload.
- `directory_depth` (int): Depth of subdirectories to search for rosbags in the base remote directory.

Example YAML configuration:
  ```yaml
  remote_user: "username"
  remote_ip: "129.215.117.104"
  remote_directory: "/mnt/mydrive/rosbags"
  cloud_upload_directory: "/mnt/vdb/data"
  clean_up: false
  upload_attempts: 3
  mcap_path: "$HOME/mcap"
  parallel_processes: 1
  directory_depth: 1
  ```

### 4. Script Workflow
- Measures available bandwidth using `iperf3`.
- Creates a remote temporary directory for storing compressed `.mcap` files.
- Lists all `.mcap` files in the specified directory.
- Displays the total number of files, their combined size, and the estimated upload time based on the measured bandwidth.
- Prompts for user confirmation before proceeding with the upload.
- Compresses each `.mcap` file using mcap CLI with zstd level 2.
- Uploads each compressed file to the remote server using `rsync`.
- Verifies the integrity of each uploaded file.
- Deletes the original and compressed files from the vehicle after successful upload and verification, if `clean_up` is set to `true`.

### 5. Logging
The script logs its activities to `upload_vehicle_data_<timestamp>.log`. This log file includes:
  - Information about the processed files.
  - Bandwidth measurements.
  - Any errors encountered during the process.
